              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Founded in 2023, MyEase was born from a personal frustration with complex government
                procedures. Our founder spent weeks navigating the bureaucratic maze to get a simple
                document processed and thought, "There must be a better way."
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                That's when the idea for MyEase was conceived - a platform that combines technology
                and human expertise to simplify government processes for everyone. Since then, we've
                grown to help thousands of citizens across India navigate everything from passport
                applications to property registrations with ease.
